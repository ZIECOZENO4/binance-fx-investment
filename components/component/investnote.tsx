            1.1. Problem Statement
          </h3>
          <p>
            The traditional financial system is plagued by inefficiencies, high costs, and barriers to access. Legacy
            payment networks are slow, often taking days to settle transactions, and are prone to outages and security
            vulnerabilities. In addition, the intermediaries involved in the current system, such as banks and payment
            processors, add layers of complexity and fees, making cross-border transactions especially cumbersome and
            expensive.
